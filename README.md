## About Me

I love everything about technology and enjoy exploring new programming languages. However, Python holds a special place in my heart. As a data scientist, I'm always curious to see what insights can be revealed from data. In my spare time, I enjoy reading books on various topics and watching TED Talks.

## My Projects

Here are some of the projects that I've worked on:

- **Predicting Iraqi Students' GPAs:** In this project, I trained a machine learning model to predict the average grades of Iraqi students based on their grades from previous years.
- **Predicting Heart Attacks:** I created a machine learning model that could predict a person's risk of having a heart attack based on their medical records.
- **Basic House Price Prediction in Tehran:** In this project, I created a basic model to determine the estimated price of a house based on its location and the number of rooms.
- **Color Detection using OpenCV:** I developed an application using OpenCV which detects and recognizes colors from an image.
- **Line and Angle Detection using OpenCV:** In this project, I created a Python application which can detect lines and angles from images using OpenCV.
- **Fibonacci Numbers:** I created a program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number using Python.
- **Project Euler Solutions:** Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. I solved several of these problems using Python.
